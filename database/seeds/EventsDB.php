'Introduction to robotics is one of our workshops that successfully produced an IR Robot and taught our attendees how to use C programming language, Arduino language, basic electronic elements, how to make a PCB and microcontrollers as well as how to make a line tracking and sensor Robot that can avoid hitting walls and people while walking by IR sensors. In its second edition it was able to calculate and replace its way to reach its destination as fast and as safe as possible.',
