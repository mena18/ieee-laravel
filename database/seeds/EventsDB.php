But since it’s a special thing to find most of your field weapons joined in one place and starting from this idea we, IEEEPUASB, decided to create our first annual scientific conference which is [Mega Brain To Be]. That means in every year we’ll be focusing on a certain skill so that we would benefit you with the largest amount of skills try to upgrade the human mind to the MEGA [ ultimate ]which is 10 ^ 6.
